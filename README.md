# running-form
This project will look at your running form using the Mediapipe library from Google. It takes pose landmarks and calculates angles of joints in relation to each other.

Using this, the program can look at the form of professional athletes and calculate what the ideal running form is. 
When someone takes a video of themself running, they can pass it through the program to see how good their running form is.
